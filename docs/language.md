# Firebase Bolt Security and Modeling Language

This language is meant to be used as a convenient front-end to the existing
Firebase JSON-based rules language.

# File Structure

A bolt file consists of 3 types of statements:

  - Types: Definition of an object schema.
  - Paths: Definition of storage locations, and what type of accesses are allowed there.
  - Functions: Global function expressions which can be called from other expressions
    to be used as helpers.

A bolt file can also contain JavaScript-style comments:

```javascript
// Single line comment

/* Multi
   line
   comment
*/
```

# Types

A (user-defined) type statement describes a value that can be stored in the Firebase database.

```javascript
type MyType [extends BaseType] {
  property1: Type,
  property2: Type,
  ...

  validate() { <validation expression> }
  }
}
```

If the `validate` expression is `false`, then the value is deemed to be invalid and cannot
be saved to the database (an error will be returned to the Firebase client).

Within the `validate` expression, the special value `this` references the object
of type, `MyType`. Properties of `MyType` can be referenced in expressions like
`this.property1`.

Types can extend other types by using the `extends` clause. If not given,
`Object` is assumed when `MyType` has child properties (or `Any` if it does not).  Types
which extend an Object, can add additional properties to the Object, in addition to
a `validate` expression.

Built-in base types are also similar to JavaScript types:

    String            - Stings
    Number            - Integer or floating point
    Boolean           - Values true or false
    Object            - A structured object containing named properties.
    Any               - Every non-null value is of type Any.
    Null              - Value null (same as absence of a value, or deleted)
    Map<Key, Value>   - A generic type - maps string valued keys to corresponding
                        values (similar to an Object type).
    Type[]            - An "array-like" type (actually same as Map<String, Type>
                        where Type can be any other built-in or user-defined type.

Any of the built-in scalar types can be _extended_ by adding a validation expression, e.g.:

```javascript
type ShortString extends String {
  validate() { this.length < 32 }
}

type Percentage extends Number {
  validate() { this >=0 && this <= 100 }
}
```

Notes:

- Object types are required to have at least one property when present.
- Map types can be empty collections (they need not contain any child keys).

## Type Expressions

Any place a Type can be used, it can be replaced with a Type expression.  We support
three types of type expressions:

### Union Types

    Type1 | Type2    - Value can be either of two types.
    Type | Null      - An optional `Type` value (value can be deleted or missing).


### Map Types (Collections)

A Map type is a built-in Generic Type (see below).  It is used to specify collections
within a model:

```javascript
type Model {
  users: Map<String, User>,
  products: Map<ProductID, Product>
}

type ProductID extends String {
  validate() { this.length <= 20 }
}
```

As a shortcut for the common `Map<String, Type>`, "array-like" notation can be used:

```javascript
type Model {
  users: User[],
  products: Product[]
}
```

### Generic Types

A generic type is like a "type macro" - it is used to specify a type generically,
but then make it specific to a particular use case:

```javascript
type Pair<X, Y> {
  first: X,
  second: Y
}
```

Note that the types of the `first` and `second` properties uses the placeholder types,
`X` and `Y`.  Using a generic type is much like a function call - except using `<...>` instead
of `(...)`:

```javascript
type Model {
  name: String,
  prop: Pair<Number, String>;
}
```

# Paths

A path statement provides access and validation rules for data stored at a given path.

```javascript
path /path/to/data [is Type] {
  read() { <true-iff-reading-this-path-is-allowed> }

  write() { <true-iff-writing-this-path-is-allowed> }

  validate() { <additional-validation-rules> }
}
```

If a Type is not given, `Any` is assumed.

In `read` expressions, the value of `this` is the value stored at the path of
type, `Type`.  In `write` and `validate` expressions `this` is the value to be
stored at the path (use the `prior(this)` function to reference the previously stored
value of `this`).

The `read` and `write` expressions are used to determine when users are allowed
to read or modify the data at the given path.  These rules typically test the
value of the global `auth` variable and possibly reference other locations of the
database to determine these permissions.

The `validate` expression can be used to check for additional constraints
(beyond the Type `validate` rules) required to store a value at the given path,
and especially perform constraints that are path-dependent.  Path
templates can include _captured_ parts whose values can then be used within
an expression as a variable parameter:

```javascript
path /users/{uid} is User {
  // Anyone can read a User's information.
  read() { true }

  // Only an authenticated user can write their information.
  write() { auth != null && auth.uid == uid }
}
```

If a path needs no expressions, the following abbreviated form (without a body)
can be used:

    path /users/{uid} is User;

and the `path` keyword can also be omitted.

    /users/{uid} is User;

## String methods

The following methods can be used on string (static valued or strings stored
in the database):

    s.length            - Number of characters in the string.
    s.includes(sub)     - Returns true iff sub is a substring of s.
    s.startsWith(sub)   - Returns true iff sub is a prefix of s.
    s.endsWith(sub)     - Returns true iff sub is a suffix of s.
    s.replace(old, new) - Returns a string where all occurances of string, `old`, are
                          replaced by `new`.
    s.toLowerCase()     - Returns an all lower case version of s.
    s.toUpperCase()     - Returns an all upper case version of s.
    s.test(regexp)      - Returns true iff the string matches the regular expression.

[Regular Expression Syntax](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/api/string/matches.html)

## Database references

References to data locations (starting with `this` or `root`) can be further qualified
using the `.` and `[]` operators (just as in JavaScript Object references).

    ref.child           - Returns the property `child` of the reference.
    ref[s]              - Return property referenced by the string, variable, `s`.
    ref.parent()        - Returns the parent of the given refererence
                          (e.g., ref.prop.parent() is the same as ref).

To reference the previous value of a property (in a write() or validate() rule), use
the `prior()` function:

    prior(this)         - Value of `this` before the write is completed.
    prior(this.prop)    - Value of a property before the write is completed.

`prior()` can be used to wrap any expressions (including function calls) that
use `this`.

The parent key of the current location can be read using the key() function.

    key()               - The (text) value of the inner-most parent property of the current location.

This can be used to create a validation expression that relates the key used to store a value
and one of its properties:

```javascript
path /products is Product[];

type Product {
  validate() { this.id == key() }

  id: String,
  name: String
}

```


# Functions and Methods

Functions must be simple return expressions with zero or more parameters.  All of the following
examples are identical and can be used interchangably.

```javascript
function isUser(uid) {
  return auth != null && auth.uid == uid;
}

function isUser(uid) { auth != null && auth.uid == uid }

isUser(uid) { auth != null && auth.uid == uid }
```

Similarly, methods in path and type statements can use the abbreviated functional form (all
these are equivalent):

```javascript
write() { return this.user == auth.uid; }
write() { this.user == auth.uid; }
write() { this.user == auth.uid }
```

# Expressions

Rule expressions are a subset of JavaScript expressions, and include:

  - Unary operators: - (minus), ! (boolean negation)
  - Binary operators: +, -, *, /, %

# Global variables

These global variables are available in expressions:

    root - The root location of a Firebase database.
    auth - The current auth state (if auth != null the user is authenticated, and auth.uid
           is their user identifier string).
    now -  The (Unix) timestamp of the current time (a Number).
