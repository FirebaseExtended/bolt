# Bolt Compiler

Bolt is an experimental security and rules compiler for Firebase.  It is currently
in beta.  The language definition is converging, yet not yet finalized.  We welcome
experimentation, but ask that you hand-verify the resulting JSON output before
using with production applications.

Otherwise, we'd love to have feedback from early adopters.  You can email questions
to firebase-talk@googlegroups.com using "Bolt" in the subject line, or post bugs
on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/firebase/bolt/issues).

# Language Definition

  - [Guide to Using Firebase Bolt](docs/guide.md) - Introduction to using Bolt.
  - [Firebase Security and Modeling Language](docs/language.md) - Language documentation and syntax.

# Using the Bolt Compiler

You can easily install the bolt compiler using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

    $ npm install --global firebase-bolt

Execute the Bolt compiler from the command line (it reads a Bolt file from standard input and writes a JSON
rules file to standard output):

    $ firebase-bolt < rules.bolt > rules.json

You can then upload the resulting rules.json file via the
[firebase command line](https://www.firebase.com/docs/hosting/command-line-tool.html):

    $ firebase deploy

_The firebase command line tool version 2 will also compile your Bolt file directly if you have firebase-bolt
installed and you use the .bolt file extension in the rules property of your firebase.json
configuration file._
