Bolt is an experimental security and rules compiler for Firebase.  It is currently
in early alpha.  There are known bugs and incomplete features in the current
implementation, so PLEASE DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION applications.

Otherwise, we'd love to have feedback from early adopters.  You can email questions
to firebase-talk@googlegroups.com using "Bolt" in the subject line.

You can easily install the bolt compiler using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

Execute the Bolt compiler from the command line (it reads a Bolt file from standard input and write a JSON
rules file to standard output):
